        After spending a long time isolated in my room, meditating and honing my magical powers, I felt as though I had more control over my magic than I once had before I started meditating two weeks ago. I came out of my room and put my strengthened magical abilities to the test. I went to the training room and used my abilities on a training dummy and showed the improvements I’ve made over the past 2 weeks to my father who was surprised to see how much I progressed since he last saw me. After contemplating and discussing of how I can better control my magical powers my father asked that I don’t use too much of my magic as it might easily exhaust my mana reserves too quickly and I wouldn’t have enough mana left to use to cast any spells during crucial moments through our planned assault on the castle.\n\n
        As we were preparing for the assault on the castle, my father heard from one of the members that within the depths of labyrist lies a secret room that holds a magical ring that increases one’s magical power by half their initial magical power and as such, my father suggested that we take the time to explore the dungeons of labyrist below and try to look for the ring as we would want to gain any advantage we’d need for the attack on the castle and the king’s court mage that was rumored to be the strongest mage within the kingdom’s walls.\n\n
        As the day of assaulting the castle came upon us, my father had one last request for me before we left the hideout. He asked that me and the supposedly best mage within labyrist to spar in a one on one match where we would use our abilities to incapacitate the other through the battle without any limitations, and as such, the rest of the members acted as spectators and watch over how the match between me and my opponent would come out. This served as my initiation to show that I am fully capable of wielding my magic and using it against our enemies.\n\n

    <string name="Ending1">  I choose to agree and go with my father to the dungeon first as my mother’s safety is my utmost priority and of course, I do miss her greatly and ever since the incident that night, not seeing her has brought me nothing but anguish and sadness, as such we set off to the castle dungeons entrance and we are immediately faced with the guards protecting the entrance along with their tamed rock lizard. My father and I agree to split on taking the opposition where my father takes on the two other knights while I deal with the giant rock lizard. As we further ventured into the depths of the dungeon we encountered more and more prisoners from wounded to dead.\n\n
        This was not something I would expect to see in my life and normally seeing the sorry sights of these prisoners would be enough to make anyone break down out of fear. But I knew I did not have time to waste and so we hastened our steps toward the deeper part of the dungeon where my mother Friede was held. As we approached the part of the dungeon where my mother was supposedly held, there were less and less knights guarding the area however, there was one last dark knight patrolling the area that seemed entirely different from all the other knights we faced so far throughout the dungeon. My father recognized him and said that the knight who was clad in dark armor was called the warden, his body was constantly imbued with magic and so not any normal person can stand up against him in a duel. However I cannot allow him to stand in between me and reunite my family once again.\n\n
        As we ended the life of the warden who had been guarding the depths of the dungeon, we finally reached the cell holding my mother where we found her lying on the ground, to our relief, she was only unconscious, and so we hurriedly brought her out of the dungeon and brought her to someplace hidden where we can return when all the fighting is all over, I told my father that I alone should go to the throne room and face the king myself and that he should stay with my mother to protect her from anything that comes near. He hesitantly agrees to my decision and bids me goodluck to my battle against the king.\n\n
        As I fight my way through the knights guarding the way to the throne room through the hallway, an ominous aura continues to exude more and more as I get closer to the royal chambers. I stand in front of the door and open it slowly where I am greeted by a giant ball of flame hurled towards me. I narrowly dodged the incoming spell but was slightly burnt from the intensity of its flames. The last thing that was stopping me from standing in front of the king was the court mage who had been serving the king since his childhood. The final battle to end it once and for all. \n\n
        With the court mage now gone, I finally stood in front of the king and without letting him get any chance to fight back, I drew my sword one more time and thrust it through his chest, ending his life right then and there… I returned to where my parents were hiding and disappeared from the castle yard without a trace. The clashing of Labyrist members and knights of the king had died down until nothing but silence was left. THE END.</string>

    <string name="ChoiceC">  After speaking with the members of labyrist over the past week, we slowly but surely got to know each other better and learned a lot about their past experiences and the tips they shared that could be used in the middle of combat. As we got to know each other more, we held sparring matches every now and then as a form of training to learn how to better use the abilities and skills I learned from them in a practical battle without any restrictions. In between all the losses, draws and wins, one thing is for sure, and it’s that I definitely gained valuable combat experience that will help me in the coming battles ahead. I approached my father after one of my training sessions and asked him if there was anything I could do to help the members of labyrist to thank them for the help they’ve given me since the time I’ve arrived.\n\n
        My father pondered for a while and came up with an idea, he suggested that I go down into the dungeons and search for the cellars that were said to hold beer and wine alike that can be used to boost the morale of all the members before we leave for the attack on the castle. I thought that it would be a fine idea and agreed to his suggestion, and so I prepared for my descent and faced different monsters before  entering the room that contained the barrels of grog for the party. As I was preparing and making sure that the barrels were intact and filled with what we expected, suddenly I was attacked from behind by a large sewer rat that seemed to be different from the ones I’ve faced, one that was emanating a noxious fume that seemed to be fatal if I fought the monster for too long.\n\n
        After the battle, I took a short break and returned to the main room with my father waiting for my report on what I found in the cellars. After hearing my encounter with the poisonous rat, he was relieved to see that I made it out alive and even happier to hear that the barrels of beer and wine were completely fine after all this time and proceeded to share the news to the members of labyrist. My father sent an expedition group down to the cellars to collect the barrels to bring up in preparation for the party. Later that night we drank and partied to our hearts content and spent the next few days setting up the last preparations we’d need to face the knights and the king in his castle.\n\n</string>
    <string name="ChoiceD"> After spending the next 3 weeks studying in the Arlestein Library, I obtained a multitude of knowledge that I used to better enhance the current magic I used through the means of altering the sequences in the casting of the magic itself to further increase the efficiency of the spell itself. This allowed my magical abilities to better aid me in my battles ahead. After I returned from the library and spoke with my father in the Labyrist hideout, he came to me with a dire expression, looking as though there was a major problem that occurred whilst I was away and that was indeed the case. He had apparently sent an expedition down into the hideout’s depths to procure more equipment and items that could be used to further increase our chances in succeeding in our siege of the castle.\n\n
        My father told me that the expedition he sent the day before had yet to return and he was worried for their lives considering they weren’t entirely aware of all the monsters that existed and roamed within the depths of their hideout. So my father asked that I rescue them or at least figure out what happened whilst saying that this would be the trial set for me to see if the knowledge I obtained during my stay in the Arlestein library studying was worth the time spent for it. And so I agreed thinking that it would also be the prime opportunity to make use of the knowledge I obtained in order to find out what happened to the expedition that we lost contact with.\n\n
        As I entered the Labyrist hideout depths, I encountered a number of corpses, and monsters that were wandering around that seemed like the expedition missed out while exploring the area. I took care of them and proceeded to go deeper into the dungeons, after spending a few hours looking for the people who were sent into the dungeon and heard someone from the dark side of the room, to my surprise, it was one of the members who was barely breathing and it seemed he wouldn’t make it, however I reassured him and healed him with the increased magical power of my healing spell. He then told me that they encountered a monster that was unlike what they had seen before and so the rest of the expedition ran away and headed deeper into the dungeon to try and hide from it. I took this information and proceeded into the depths and tried to look for the rest of the members and encountered the monster that fit the description of what the previous person I’d encountered said. A dark lion with a silver mane and golden eyes. As soon as it saw me, it immediately ran towards me and moved at an incredibly fast speed. I thought to myself that I didn’t have the option to run and so I stood my ground and got ready to face the fatal trial ahead of me. As soon as I finished off the monster in front of me, it seemed that the door that it was guarding opened and showed the surviving members of the expedition. They cried out for joy and returned with me back to the main room of the Labyrist headquarters. As the surviving members were being treated, one of them approached me and gave me a book they had found which contained knowledge of stronger offensive magic that I could learn to use and add to my arsenal of magical abilities. We spent the last few days recovering and preparing for the planned attack against the castle and the tyrannical king.\n\n

    <string name="ChoiceA">I chose to further hone my abilities under the tutelage of my father whom I trusted the most as he was the one who saved me from when the house was on fire and the one who I believe wants to save mother the most. Since he knows me best, he’ll be able to teach me what I do right and wrong during our training sessions. The week of harsh and strict training passed by and I felt myself more confident and capable of holding my sword in a steady grip. He gave me one final test, to explore the deepest part of the Labyrist headquarter dungeons and defeat the monster guarding their armory that held their best arms and armor that can be used in battling against enemies in the castle dungeons\n\n</string>
